# photomosaic

The goal is to be a repo for a photomosaic app using an image and a photo database provided by the user. Essentially it will assemble a reasonable likeness of the original image using scaled versions of other photos in the database and matching photos in the database as closely as possible to parts of the original image by color. 

It uses C++11 standards and QT 5.7 compiler. Example database downloaded from Artensoft.com/ArtensoftPhotoMosaicWizard/photobases.php for personal use and demonstration of functionality.

Known issues and next steps:
	1. Algorithm improvement
		1. Duplicate reduction
	2. Some images in database are null
	3. Support for image formats other than PNG
	4. UI improvements
		1. Unknown errors in QT output - doesn't impact program but worth investigating
