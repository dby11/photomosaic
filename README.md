# photomosaic

The goal is to be a repo for a photomosaic app using an image and a photo database provided by the user. Essentially it will assemble a reasonable likeness of the original image using scaled versions of other photos in the database and matching photos in the database as closely as possible to parts of the original image by color. 

Example database downloaded from Artensoft.com/ArtensoftPhotoMosaicWizard/photobases.php for personal use and demonstration of functionality.
